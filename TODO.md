- move away from fixed with, fix that bug, and get the pages displaying nicely on tablets and phones

  - or throttling
  - what would the second-order effects be?

  - "user:cobb consciousness" (turns up stuff like http://readertron.com/reader/posts/51763)
  - "comment:(avinash saltines)"
  - "shared:true "marginal revolution" krugman"
- style in bookmarklet should be clean and consistent on any website. expanding the note area should be easier. ideally we'd get the github box in the bookmarklet.
- fix timezone of comments
- comment box should be taller to begin with, and expandable to whatever size you want
- fix spacing before timestamp/permalink of certain comments (as here: http://readertron.com/reader/posts/417247)

- collapsed view
- producer vs. consumpto (ratio of stories shared to read).
- "you haven't shared in a while"
- search should be faster
  - keep an eye on memory usage
  - why two index delayed jobs on adding a post?
  - upgrade to ubuntu 12.04 and oracle java 7.
- go back to sending share emails one at a time, share emails should use the magic links
- change the copy in share emails to make the clickable area of "go to the post's page" slightly bigger
- mentions in share note shouldn't do anything extra, just bold the text, unless the person you're mentioning doesn't follow you. in that case the share should be sent to them anyway, with a note that they were mentioned specifically

- mentions in comments should send an email with a different subject line than normal

- in fact comments pane should only show you comments you haven't seen (i.e., for threads you're not a participant on)
