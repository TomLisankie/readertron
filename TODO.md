- Not sure how much harder this is, but can you have people's comments be unread items next to their name in "Other Shared Items"?

- @ing people in notes and comments. What should the behavior be?
- mentioning @all
- mentions in share note shouldn't do anything extra, just bold the text, unless the person you're mentioning doesn't follow you. in that case the share should be sent to them anyway, with a note that they were mentioned specifically
- a "Mentions" thing in the sidebar
- mentions in comments should send an email with a different subject line than normal

- one-click evernote integration.

- style in bookmarklet should be clean and consistent on any website. expanding the note area should be easier. ideally we'd get the github box in the bookmarklet.

- prevent email duplicates and share/unshare/share rss problem with little delay (same with comments)

- share later
  - or throttling
  - what would the second-order effects be?
- change subject line of comment emails to distinguish them more from shares
- scroll up on search results should move blue bar too
- more responsive "Quickpost" submit button.
- add Kraft, add Alkire
- ability to add a comment from within search results, without having to click the permalink
- scribd doc with secret_password param should automatically include it in embed url so that the embed works
- readertron weekly digest should be "from" "Readertron Weekly Digest" and the subject line should be comment content...
- now that we're deleting old posts, allow starring.
- collapsed view
- producer vs. consumpto (ratio of stories shared to read).
- "you haven't shared in a while"
- search
  - keep an eye on memory usage
  - why two index delayed jobs on adding a post?
  - upgrade to ubuntu 12.04 and oracle java 7.
- go back to sending share emails one at a time, share emails should use the magic links
- change the copy in share emails to make the clickable area of "go to the post's page" slightly bigger
- single post should show within the regular pane.
- Reach out to non-participants.
- email links in regular share emails?
- fix annoying click scroll-to-top as on http://readertron.com/reader/posts/390710#comment-638
- apple-K for links.
- option persisted on users to sort things "newest first".
- simple graphs on the admin page.
- printing a post
- better, simpler flow for adding new feeds.
- publish button
- keep an eye on feeds that haven't gotten a post in a while.
- is Feedzirra not getting new posts quickly enough?
- absolutizing relative URLs within posts, as in post 62 (in production).
- look at 404s to see which images are still broken?
- zen mode for long comments?
